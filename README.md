Hurried Herding	:
A continuation of a school assignment in my algorithms course, the program accepts in a file which should consists of a list of records which follow the same format. The first value of a record is a Cow’s ID number, the second value is the action to be performed such as a weighing, milking, or a temperature check. Third value is the value associated with the action, for example if the action was ‘M’, the third value would represent the amount of milk produced, or if the action was ‘W’, the third value would represent the weight of the specified Cow.

Motivation :
The original purpose of this project was for a school assignment, after graduating I decided to build more into the project to make it more of a portfolio project. I hope to show my skills with Java, whether it be inheritance, data structures, efficient programming, or anything else which deals with Java. 

Running :
 In order to run this program, download or clone the repository to your local machine. Compile the .java files followed by running the Practice class. Should read the list of data in the existing file, and then ask the user if they wish to add any more records to the current process.
